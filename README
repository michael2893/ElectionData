Been increasingly interested in this election fraud thing. Here are some fragments of a script I wrote in R, just showing the commands step-by-step illustrating a really interesting pattern. I sort of borrowed from the Stanford guy to explore this myself...The null is basically there is no relationship between paper trails and Clinton's success. What I ended up doing was converting the nominal data into boolean values and splitting them up into two experiments. In each I used monte carlo simulation with 2000 replicates, as you can see. In the first I didn't split the vectors up. In the second I created two vectors where one was "no paper trail" and the other was "paper trail." I did this just to ensure precision. I performed a chi-square test with a control for p, as some of the values were well below five. I also conducted fisher's exact test, which is shown. I followed this up with Barnards test. There wasn't enough room to display the results of that test as it's a little more complicated and took up too much space. Not surprisingly, it yielded similar results. Basically, if the p value is VERY close to 1, R will just spit out 1.
